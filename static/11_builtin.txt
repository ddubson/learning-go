[["Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight","Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay","Rage, rage against the dying of the light"],["And you, my father, there on the sad height,","Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.","Do not go gentle into that good night.","Rage, rage against the dying of the light."]]
